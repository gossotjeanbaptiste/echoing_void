# Echoing Void — Wiki

A Fabric mod for Minecraft **26.1.2** (Fabric Loader 0.19.3+, Java 25+, requires Fabric API). Mod id: `echoing_void`, current version `1.0.0`.

The mod is themed around Minecraft Dungeons' *Echoing Void* DLC, transplanted into the End dimension: unique enemies (Watchling, Blastling), two signature legendary weapons (The Beginning and The End, Call of the Void), a Void Poisoned status effect, and a full beyond-netherite "Enderite" material/gear progression that generates in the End's outer islands.

## Blocks

| Block | Hardness / Blast Res. | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Void Stone** (`void_stone`) | 50.0 / 1200.0 | Requires a diamond+ pickaxe. No crafting recipe and no worldgen source yet — see [Known Gaps](#known-gaps--wip-notes). Used as an ingredient in the End Brewing Stand and Enderite Upgrade Template recipes. |
| **End Brewing Stand** (`end_brewing_stand`) | 0.5 | Rarity RARE. A `BrewingStandBlock` subclass with its own block entity; functions as a normal brewing stand plus one exclusive recipe (see below). Naturally replaces any vanilla brewing stand generated inside End City structures. |
| **Enderite Debris** (`enderite_debris`) | 40.0 / 1200.0 | Rarity RARE. Ore block, generates in the outer End islands. Needs a netherite pickaxe or better (see [Tool Gating](#tool-gating)). |
| **Block of Enderite** (`enderite_block`) | 60.0 / 1600.0 | Storage block for 9 Enderite Ingots. Needs a netherite pickaxe or better. |

### Tool Gating

Minecraft's post-1.21 tool system determines "correct tool" per block via tags, not a strict tier ranking. `enderite_debris` / `enderite_block` are added to `minecraft:needs_diamond_tool` (which every `incorrect_for_<tier>_tool` tag up to diamond references transitively) **and** explicitly to `minecraft:incorrect_for_diamond_tool`. Net effect: diamond and everything below can still swing at the block (at bare-hand speed, since `requiresCorrectToolForDrops()` is set) but only a netherite pickaxe (or the enderite material below) is "correct" — full speed and drops.

### End Brewing Stand — recipe to make one

```
 P
E B V
 P
```
`P` = Ender Pearl, `E` = End Stone, `B` = Brewing Stand, `V` = Void Stone → 1 End Brewing Stand.

## Items

### Beyond-Netherite Material Chain

| Item | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Enderite Scrap** | Smelt/blast `enderite_debris` (200/100 ticks, 2.0 XP) | Rarity Uncommon, fire resistant. |
| **Enderite Ingot** | Shaped craft: 4× Diamond, 4× Enderite Scrap, 1× Netherite Ingot (center) | Rarity Rare, fire resistant. Also 9-ingot ↔ 1-block compacting/uncompacting recipes with `enderite_block`. |

### Enderite Upgrade Smithing Template

A real `SmithingTemplateItem` (not a generic item) — carries the vanilla-style "Applies to / Ingredients" tooltip and ghost-icon slot hints in the smithing table UI (reusing vanilla's generic tool/armor slot sprites; there is no vanilla "bow" sprite, so the bow upgrade isn't shown in the icon rotation even though the recipe itself works).

- **Obtained**: found rarely in End City chests (see [Loot Tables](#loot-tables)), or duplicated at a crafting table:
  ```
  N S N
  V E V
  N N N
  ```
  `N` = Netherite Ingot, `S` = existing template, `V` = Void Stone, `E` = End Stone → 2 templates (consumes 1 to make 2, net +1 — same mechanic as vanilla's Netherite Upgrade Template duplication).

### Enderite Gear (11 smithing-table upgrades)

All upgraded from their **netherite** equivalent (not diamond, unlike vanilla) at a smithing table using: Enderite Upgrade Template + the netherite item + 1 Enderite Ingot.

| Result | Base item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enderite Pickaxe | `minecraft:netherite_pickaxe` | Same base attack numbers as netherite (1.0 dmg / -2.8 speed) |
| Enderite Axe | `minecraft:netherite_axe` | 5.0 dmg / -3.0 speed |
| Enderite Shovel | `minecraft:netherite_shovel` | 1.5 dmg / -3.0 speed |
| Enderite Hoe | `minecraft:netherite_hoe` | 0.0 dmg / -4.0 speed |
| Enderite Spear | `minecraft:netherite_spear` | Same 9 tuning figures as netherite_spear; distinct from the two legendary weapons below |
| Enderite Helmet/Chestplate/Leggings/Boots | matching `netherite_*` piece | See armor material below |
| **The Beginning and The End** | `minecraft:netherite_sword` | Legendary sword, see below |
| **Call of the Void** | `minecraft:bow` | Legendary bow — base is the plain vanilla bow since bows have no material tiers; the upgrade still works mechanically even though it's not a "typical" smithing pairing |

All improvement over netherite comes purely from the shared **`ModToolMaterials.ENDERITE`** tool material and **`ModArmorMaterials.ENDERITE`** armor material (no reinvented per-item numbers), exceeding real netherite stats:

| Stat | Netherite (vanilla) | Void-Touched / Enderite (this mod) |
|---|---|---|
| Tool durability | 2031 | 3000 |
| Tool attack dmg bonus | 4.0 | 5.0 |
| Tool enchantability | 15 | 20 |
| Armor durability multiplier | 37 | 48 |
| Armor defense (boots/legs/chest/helmet) | 3 / 6 / 8 / 3 | 4 / 7 / 9 / 4 |
| Armor toughness | 3.0 | 4.0 |
| Armor knockback resistance | 0.1 | 0.15 |

Repair material for the whole line (tools, armor, and the two legendary weapons) is the `echoing_void:enderite_repair` item tag, populated with just `enderite_ingot`.

### Legendary Weapons

Both are Epic rarity, carry an innate **Void Strike I** (not a curse — survives grindstone, since `GrindstoneMenuMixin` re-applies level 1 after any grind pass), and are repairable on an anvil with an Enderite Ingot.

- **The Beginning and The End** (`the_beginning_of_the_end`) — sword, `ModToolMaterials.ENDERITE` material, 3.0 dmg / **-1.6** speed (faster than a plain netherite/enderite sword's -2.4). Tagged into vanilla's `minecraft:swords` item tag. Landing 3 hits within 30 ticks plays a distinct "combo finisher" sound (`TheBeginningOfTheEndCombo`), mirroring the Dungeons dual-dagger 3-hit-then-spin identity. Has dedicated equip/pick-up/drop sounds.
- **Call of the Void** (`call_of_the_void`) — custom `CallOfTheVoidBowItem`, 900 durability, enchantability 15. A fully-charged shot (power ≥ 2.99) tags the arrow as a "charged shot" and plays a distinct charged-shot/impact sound pair; a normal shot plays the regular pair. Tagged into vanilla's `enchantable/bow` and `enchantable/durability` tags (so Mending/Unbreaking etc. apply normally, since it isn't natively a `BowItem` subtype recognized by those tags by default). Has its own equip/pick-up/drop sounds too.

### Void Poisoned Potions

- **Potion of Void Poisoned** (`void_poisoned_potion`) — **only** brewable in an **End Brewing Stand**: Awkward Potion + Ender Pearl (the ender pearl is otherwise not a valid ingredient in vanilla's `PotionBrewing` registry; a mixin whitelists it specifically for this block's ingredient slot).
- **Splash** / **Lingering** variants — convertible in *any* brewing stand, vanilla-style: + Gunpowder → Splash, + Dragon Breath → Lingering.
- Applies the [Void Poisoned effect](#mob-effect-void-poisoned) for 260 ticks (13s) by default.

### Spawn Eggs

`watchling_spawn_egg` / `blastling_spawn_egg` — real functional spawn eggs (creative/command only, not craftable), same as vanilla.

---

## Mob Effect: Void Poisoned

Harmful effect, color `#9C1FB0`. Ticks 3.0 damage (`damageSources().magic()`) every `20 >> amplifier` ticks (i.e. faster at higher amplifier). Plays an activate sound on application and a deactivate sound when it wears off (`LivingEntityMixin#onEffectsRemoved`).

**Immune**: anything in the `echoing_void:immune_to_void_poisoned` entity type tag — vanilla Enderman, Watchling, Blastling (all "of the void", so it doesn't poison itself or its own kind).

---

## Enchantment: Void Strike

Data-driven enchantment (`data/echoing_void/enchantment/void_strike.json`), max level 3, mainhand slot only, weight 3, anvil cost 4. Applies a damage multiplier: ×1.33 / ×1.66 / ×2.0 by level. Supported items: anything in `echoing_void:enchantable/void_strike` (weapon + bow + crossbow enchantable tags). Explicitly added to `minecraft:in_enchanting_table` so it can roll at the enchanting table (custom enchantments don't show up there without this tag).

Obtainable: enchanting table/anvil books, or naturally on gear found in End City chests (an enchanted book pool and a weapon pool — diamond sword/axe/spear/bow — both added via `ModLootTables` using Fabric's `LootTableEvents.MODIFY`, stacking additively on top of the datapack-level JSON overrides on `end_city_treasure`).

---

## Entities

### Watchling (`watchling`)

Enderman-flavored monster. 30 HP, 0.3 movement speed, 4.0 attack damage, 0 armor.

- **Goals** (priority order): float → teleport-to-target (when target is out of melee range or line-of-sight is blocked) → melee attack → stare-at-distant-player → wander → look-at-player/random-look.
- **Attack**: 25% chance of a "heavy attack" (×1.65 damage) that also applies Void Poisoned; melee reach 2.5 blocks.
- **Teleport**: on taking damage, 50% chance to teleport-escape (like Enderman); scans downward for solid ground before landing, same portal-particle burst on both ends. Briefly hidden client-side (`teleportHidden`) right after teleporting.
- **Water**: sensitive to water — takes periodic damage while in it and immediately teleport-escapes on first contact.
- **Stare goal**: between 16–32 blocks from a player it can see (and has no combat target), it freezes and stares — a passive "being watched" moment rather than a threat.
- **Rendering**: custom model + glowing eyes layer with 3 blink stages (open / half / closed), hidden during the teleport-hide window (but *not* hidden by real Invisibility, Enderman-style).
- **Loot**: 1–3 ender pearls (weighted like vanilla Enderman).
- **Custom spawner** (`WatchlingSpawner`, not `BiomeModifications.addSpawn`): every 200 ticks, per non-spectator player in the End, attempts a group spawn (3–6 mobs) 28–48 blocks away, snapped to the real column surface height. This deliberately bypasses vanilla `NaturalSpawner`'s uniform-random-Y-then-search approach, which is heavily biased toward low altitude on the End's floating islands (most of that Y range is void under a high island).

### Blastling (`blastling`)

Ranged-only monster, no melee. 16 HP, 0.3 movement speed, 0 armor.

- **Goals**: float → teleport-away (if target closes within 6 blocks) → ranged attack (8–16 tick interval, 16-block radius) → wander → look-at-player/random-look.
- **Ranged attack**: fires a `BlastlingGooEntity` — a flat, non-arcing "spit" (no gravity) aimed directly at the target's predicted position, unlike vanilla's lobbed throwables.
- **Teleport**: always teleports away on taking damage (no % roll, unlike Watchling); same ground-scan/particle/sound treatment.
- **Rendering**: custom model plus a separate animated flame layer (32-frame `flame_01.png`…`flame_32.png` sequence) rendered as an independent second model rather than baked into the main geometry.
- **Loot**: 1–3 ender pearls (same weights as Watchling).
- **Custom spawner** (`BlastlingSpawner`): identical altitude-fix approach to `WatchlingSpawner`, smaller groups (1–3).

### Blastling Goo (`blastling_goo`, projectile)

`ThrowableItemProjectile`, no gravity, 2.0 damage, capped at 60 ticks of life (since a no-gravity miss would otherwise coast forever under the 0.99/tick inertia decay). 1/3 chance to apply 3s of Void Poisoned on a living-entity hit. Bursts into portal particles and a sound on any hit, then discards. Renders client-side as a full-bright flat billboard (like a snowball/pearl), not a physical projectile.

---

## Worldgen & Structures

### Enderite Debris Ore Generation

Registered via Fabric API's `BiomeModifications` (not raw biome-JSON overrides) at the `UNDERGROUND_DECORATION` generation step — the same step real `ore_ancient_debris_*` uses in this version, confirmed by inspecting the actual game jar rather than assumed.

- **Biomes**: `end_highlands`, `end_midlands`, `end_barrens`, `small_end_islands` — the *outer* End islands only, not the central main island.
- **Two veins per chunk**, mirroring ancient debris in shape: `enderite_debris_large` (vein size 3) and `enderite_debris_small` (vein size 2), each a `minecraft:scattered_ore` feature targeting `minecraft:end_stone` → `echoing_void:enderite_debris`. Unlike ancient debris, `discard_chance_on_air_exposure` is `0.0` (never discarded), so a vein that happens to generate near a thin island's surface or an edge stays visible/exposed instead of vanishing - the intent is that it's occasionally spottable above ground, not perpetually buried.
- **Height**: `minecraft:uniform` distribution between Y=16 and Y=65 (flat probability across that band — no bias toward center or bottom, matching the request that spawn rate be roughly even regardless of layer). This differs from real `ore_ancient_debris_large`, which uses a center-biased `trapezoid`.

### End City Brewing Stand Swap

`EndCityPiecesMixin` injects a custom `StructureProcessor` (`EndBrewingStandProcessor`) into **every** End City structure piece's placement settings. That processor rewrites any vanilla `minecraft:brewing_stand` block found in the structure template into `echoing_void:end_brewing_stand` (preserving the bottle-slot block-state flags), so every End City ship generates with the mod's brewing stand already in place — no loot-table injection needed, it's a structural swap at generation time.

## Loot Tables

### End City Treasure (`minecraft:chests/end_city_treasure`)

Built from **two independent mechanisms** that stack:

1. **Datapack override** (`data/minecraft/loot_table/chests/end_city_treasure.json`) — a full copy of the vanilla table (required since loot tables replace rather than merge) with additions:
   - Main pool: `enderite_scrap` (1–2, weight 3) and `enderite_debris` (1–2, weight 2), alongside vanilla diamond/iron/gold/emerald/etc.
   - Template pool: `empty` (14) / `spire_armor_trim_smithing_template` (implicit weight 1) / `enderite_upgrade_smithing_template` (weight 2).
2. **Code-side additive modification** (`ModLootTables`, via `LootTableEvents.MODIFY`) — adds two *more* pools on top of whatever the table resolves to:
   - Enchanted book pool: `empty` (6) / a `Void Strike I–III` book (1).
   - Weapon pool: `empty` (12) / Void-Strike-enchanted Diamond Sword, Diamond Axe, Diamond Spear, or Bow (weight 1 each).

### Mob Drops

Watchling and Blastling both drop 1–3 Ender Pearls (weighted 45 empty / 30×1 / 20×2 / 5×3).

### Block Drops

Standard single-item self-drops (with `survives_explosion`) for Void Stone, Enderite Debris, Enderite Block. The End Brewing Stand's drop also copies its custom name (if renamed) from the block entity via `copy_components`.

## Client-Side Features

### Rendering

- **Watchling**: custom body model + `WatchlingEyesLayer` (glowing eyes, 3 blink stages, hidden only during the teleport-hide window).
- **Blastling**: custom body model + `BlastlingEyesLayer` + a separate animated `BlastlingFlameLayer` (32-frame flame texture sequence rendered as its own small model layered over the head).
- **Blastling Goo**: rendered via vanilla's generic `ThrownItemRenderer` as a full-bright flat billboard.

### Sky (Nuit / formerly FabricSkyboxes)

Two layered sky configs for `minecraft:the_end`:
- `echoing_void_vanilla_end` (layer 0) — re-declares the vanilla End sky.
- `echoing_void_star_twins_end` (layer 1) — a custom additive-blended "Star Twins" texture, slowly rotating, 24000-tick fade cycle, hidden underwater.

### JEI Integration

Registered as a JEI plugin (`EchoingVoidJeiPlugin`, environment: client-only). Adds:
- A dedicated **End Brewing** recipe category showing Ender Pearl + Awkward Potion → Potion of Void Poisoned (the only step that's exclusive to the End Brewing Stand — registered as its recipe catalyst).
- The Splash/Lingering Void Poisoned conversions folded into JEI's normal shared **Brewing** category (since any brewing stand can do those).
- Cleanup of phantom "generic potion" entries: registering `ModPotions.VOID_POISONED` globally makes JEI's vanilla-potion scanner also discover it on the generic `minecraft:potion` / `splash_potion` / `lingering_potion` / `tipped_arrow` items even though only the mod's own dedicated items are ever produced — those duplicates are explicitly removed at runtime. The same cleanup happens in the creative inventory tab (`ModItems`/`ModCreativeModeTabs`).
- Compiled against a locally-vendored JEI jar (`run/mods/jei-26.1.2-fabric-29.5.0.28.jar`) since no Maven build exists yet for this bleeding-edge Minecraft version — this file lives in the gitignored `run/` folder and is not tracked. The dependency is **optional at build time**: `build.gradle` checks whether the jar exists before adding it, and excludes `name/modid/client/compat/**` from the client source set entirely when it's missing, so `compileClientJava` still succeeds on a fresh clone (or after a wiped `run/` folder) — just without JEI support until the jar is put back.

## Mixins Reference

| Mixin | Target | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AbstractArrowMixin` | `AbstractArrow` | Plays Call of the Void's impact/charge-impact sound on arrow-hit-entity/block, based on the arrow's charged-shot tag |
| `BrewingStandIngredientsSlotMixin` | `BrewingStandMenu$IngredientsSlot` | Allows placing an Ender Pearl in the ingredient slot specifically when the container is an `EndBrewingStandBlockEntity` |
| `EndCityPiecesMixin` | `EndCityPieces$EndCityPiece` | Injects the brewing-stand-swap structure processor into every End City piece |
| `GrindstoneMenuMixin` | `GrindstoneMenu` | Restores innate Void Strike I on the two legendary weapons after a grind pass (it isn't a curse, so it would otherwise be stripped) |
| `InventoryMixin` | `Inventory` | Plays a weapon's equip sound on hotbar slot switch |
| `ItemEntityMixin` | `ItemEntity` | Plays a weapon's pick-up sound on `playerTouch` |
| `LivingEntityMixin` | `LivingEntity` | Blocks Void Poisoned from affecting immune entity types; plays the deactivate sound when it wears off |
| `PlayerMixin` | `Player` | Drives The Beginning and The End's 3-hit combo sound on `itemAttackInteraction`; plays a weapon's drop sound on `drop` |

(Client-only mixins are declared separately via `echoing_void.client.mixins.json` per `fabric.mod.json`.)

---

## Known Gaps / WIP Notes

- **Void Stone has no obtain path in survival** (in progress): no crafting recipe, no worldgen feature, no loot table entry beyond dropping itself when broken. It's required as an ingredient for both the End Brewing Stand and the Enderite Upgrade Template recipes, so right now those are effectively creative/command-only until Void Stone gets a source.
